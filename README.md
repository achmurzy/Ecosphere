# Ecosphere
AR app for visualizing ecosystem processes

Made by Adam Chmurzynski for Biosphere 2 at the University of Arizona

Major design issue: how to integrate experimental parameter shifts with engaging, 
simple interaction with scene design elements

(General directions to break down)
FEATURES:
-Process drone imagery to extract Biosphere 2 Models. Conceivably, make your own

(Specific work items)
TO-DO:
-Make an app icon.

NICE-TO-HAVE:
-Make the parameter surface a world canvas, and make it toggleable
-Add sprinklers to LEO, fix sunlight, remove flow/diffusion rate as a parameter (for now)
